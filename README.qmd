Viash helps you turn a script (Bash/R/Python/Scala/JavaScript) into a reusable component. 
By providing some meta-data regarding its functionality and
the platform on which you want to run the software, Viash can help you:

* Wrap your script in an executable with a CLI and --help functionality,
* Seamlessly execute your component natively on the host platform or in a Docker container
* Combine multiple components in a Nextflow pipeline, and
* Unit-test your component to ensure that it works at all times.

## Documentation
The Viash documentation is available online at [`viash.io`](https://viash.io).
