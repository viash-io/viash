viash helps you turn a script (Bash/R/Python/Scala/JavaScript) into a
reusable component. By providing some meta-data regarding its
functionality and the platform on which you want to run the software,
viash can help you:

-   wrap your script in an executable with a CLI and â€“help
    functionality,
-   seamlessly execute your component natively on the host platform or
    in a Docker container
-   combine multiple components in a Nextflow pipeline, and
-   unit-test your component to ensure that it works at all times.
